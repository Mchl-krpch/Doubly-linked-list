# Doubly-linked-list
This work is created only to improve the work of the tokenizer in my light language. The visualization of the list itself has been improved, and the logic of the location of data about tokens in the language has been thought out.

## Visualization
Implemented drawing with tables, in which it is possible to conveniently catalyze the colors and shape of the shell and easily locate information that is worthy of attention when debugging the language

## Usage
This project is extremely small, the only new thing that can be emphasized is the graphviz library with its tables and hash functions.

## Thanks! Have a good day!
