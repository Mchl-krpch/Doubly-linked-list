This work is created only to improve the work of the `tokenizer` in my `Light-lang`. The visualization of the list itself has been improved, and the logic of the location of data about tokens in the language has been thought out.

## Visualization
Implemented drawing with `tables`, in which it is possible to conveniently catalyze the colors and shape of the shell and easily locate information that is worthy of attention when debugging the language

## Usage
This project is extremely small, the only new thing that can be emphasized is the `graphviz` library with its `tables` and `hash functions.`

### Thanks! Have a good day!
